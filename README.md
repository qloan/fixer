# fixer

Write some good stuff here


# Todo:

- Support field type, number, string, bool and automatically convert on get/set
- Have "Get" honor the vals property and lookup the mapped value that "Set" currently uses
- Write and update any unit tests that fail
- Strip blanks and fillers from inputs (numbers may come in as "0041", output should be 41, input of 41 should generate 0041 if the field's filler is '0')
- Add a "justified" field to allow for left or right justification
- Figure out a good way to support "toUpperCase" on all character fields without being to verbose in the rules
- General cleanup
- Update this readme with real documentation
